## Brief

The objective for this project is to create a CRUD application with using all core modules covered during my training so far at QA.
I have created an application that has the functions of create, read, update and delete in order to operate a Gym Workouts App

### Requirements

Aswell as operating and making a CRUD application there are also other requirements such as:
* A Trello board for project tracking
* A database consisting of at least 2 tables that model and use a relationship
* A clear documentation of the design phase, application architecture and a risk assessment 
* A python functional application that shows my design
* Shown testing for my application which has automated tests for the app
* A front-end website that I must create using Flask
* A code integrated
