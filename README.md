## Brief

The objective for this project is to create a CRUD application with using all core modules covered during my training so far at QA.
I have created an application that has the functions of create, read, update and delete in order to operate a Gym Workouts App

### Requirements

Aswell as operating and making a CRUD application there are also other requirements such as:
* A Trello board for project tracking
* A relational database consisting of at least 2 tables that have a relationship
* A clear documentation of the design phase, application architecture and a risk assessment 
* A functioning CRUD application created in Python
* Shown testing for my application which uses automated tests for the app
* A front-end website that I must create using Flask
* A code integrated into GitHub
* Google Cloud Platform

### My Idea

My idea is to create an app that allows users to create a gym workout planner where users can create gym workout planned days, add, update and delete exercises within these days. The application must allow users to carry out the following: 

* Create: 
  * Workout day name 
  * Exercise names 
  * How many repetitions
  * Amount of weight used (kg)
* Read: 
  * Workout days that have been created
  * Exercises that are under each workout day
* Update: 
  * Workout days (exercises, repetitions, amount of weight used)
* Delete: 
  * Exercises under each workout day
  * Workout days
  
## Architecture 

Below is 2 entity relationship diagrams (ERD) which shows the structure of the database I am using. The first ERD is my original ERD however as my project progressed I chose certain things to not implement into my app, so therefore the second ERD is my final ERD for my app as it includes everything I implemented.

My old ERD is above where I had a many to many ERD

My new ERD is above which is more simplified and is just a one to many ERD


## Project Tracking

I tracked my progress using a trello board which is made [here](https://trello.com/b/ihNNyfj3/qa-fundamental-project)
